# ADR-004: Page Object Model Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
E2E tests need to be maintainable and scalable as the application grows. Direct page interaction in test files leads to code duplication and maintenance issues when UI changes occur.

## Decision
We will implement Page Object Model (POM) pattern for E2E tests:

1. **Encapsulation Strategy**
   - `SearchPage` class containing all search-related interactions
   - Methods for common user actions (search, verify results)
   - Locator definitions centralized in page classes

2. **Modern Playwright Patterns**
   - Constructor injection of `Page` object
   - Async/await for all page interactions
   - Method chaining for fluent test writing

3. **Unified Action Methods**
   - Combined search and verification methods
   - Consistent error handling across page objects
   - Reusable interaction patterns

4. **Test Data Separation**
   - External test data in `testData.ts`
   - Data-driven test approach without over-engineering
   - Simple object structure for test scenarios

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Maintainability** - UI changes only require updates in page objects
- **Reusability** - Common actions shared across tests
- **Readability** - Tests focus on business logic, not implementation details
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new pages and interactions
- **Consistency** - Standardized interaction patterns

### Negative
- **Initial overhead** - More files and structure to maintain
- **Learning curve** - Team needs to understand POM patterns
- **Potential over-abstraction** - Risk of creating unnecessary complexity

## Alternatives Considered
- **Direct page interaction**: Rejected due to maintenance issues
- **Complex page factory patterns**: Rejected due to over-engineering for scope
- **Cucumber/Gherkin with POM**: Rejected due to added complexity for assignment scope
