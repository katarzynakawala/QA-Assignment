# ADR-003: Allure Reporting Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Professional test reporting is essential for demonstrating test coverage, tracking results, and providing stakeholder visibility. We need a comprehensive reporting solution that works across all test types and integrates with CI/CD.

## Decision
We will integrate Allure Framework for unified test reporting:

1. **Karma-Allure Integration**
   - `karma-allure-reporter` for unit and contract tests
   - Unified reporting for Jasmine tests
   - Detailed test execution metrics

2. **Visual Dashboards**
   - Test result overview with pass/fail metrics
   - Historical trends and test execution analytics
   - Test categorization and tagging

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Automatic report generation in GitHub Actions
   - Artifact publishing for stakeholder access
   - Both local and pipeline reporting

4. **Multi-level Coverage**
   - Unit test results with detailed assertions
   - Contract test API validation results
   - Combined reporting across test pyramid

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Professional presentation** - Rich, interactive reports
- **Stakeholder visibility** - Non-technical team members can understand results
- **Historical tracking** - Trend analysis and regression detection
- **Debugging support** - Detailed failure information and categorization
- **Standard format** - Industry-standard reporting approach

### Negative
- **Additional complexity** - Extra tooling and configuration
- **Storage requirements** - Report artifacts need management
- **Learning curve** - Team needs to understand Allure concepts

## Alternatives Considered
- **Built-in Karma reporting**: Rejected due to limited visualization
